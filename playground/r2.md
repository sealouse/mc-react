is using multiple modules ok?
Absolutely! Using multiple modules in a React project is not only okay, but it's also a best practice. It helps in organizing your code, making it more modular, maintainable, and scalable. Here are some benefits of using multiple modules:

Separation of Concerns: Each module can handle a specific part of your application, making it easier to manage and understand.

Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of your application or even in different projects.

Maintainability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to maintain and debug.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously without causing conflicts.

For example, you might have separate modules for different components, utilities, and services:

jsx
// components/CustomMenu.jsx
import React from 'react';

const CustomMenu = () => {
  return <div>Custom Menu</div>;
};

export default CustomMenu;

// components/SiteProgressDial.jsx
import React from 'react';

const SiteProgressDial = () => {
  return <div>Site Progress Dial</div>;
};

export default SiteProgressDial;

// utils/helpers.js
export const formatDate = (date) => {
  // Format date logic
};

// services/api.js
export const fetchData = async (url) => {
  // Fetch data logic
};
By organizing your code into multiple modules, you can keep your project clean and efficient. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

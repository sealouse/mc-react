Dynamic imports in JavaScript and React allow you to load modules or components on demand, rather than at the initial load time. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial bundle size and loading only the necessary code when it's needed.

Here's a simple example of how to use dynamic imports in a React component:

jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

// Use lazy to dynamically import the component
const CustomMenu = lazy(() => import('./components/CustomMenu/CustomMenu'));
const SiteProgressDial = lazy(() => import('./components/SiteProgressDial/SiteProgressDial'));

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <CustomMenu />
      <SiteProgressDial />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
);

export default App;
In this example:

lazy is used to dynamically import the CustomMenu and SiteProgressDial components.

Suspense is used to wrap the lazy-loaded components and provide a fallback UI (like a loading spinner) while the components are being loaded.

This approach helps in splitting your code and loading only the parts of your application that are needed at a given time, improving the overall performance and user experience.
